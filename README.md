## Folder Naming

Each team creates **one folder** following this format:

Team<TeamNumber><USN><ShortTopicName>


- **TeamNumber**: your assigned team number  
- **USN**: any one team memberâ€™s USN  
- **ShortTopicName**: a brief name for your project (no spaces, use CamelCase)

> **Example:**  
> `Team05_1RV21CS001_SmartIrrigation`

## Option 1: Using Git (Quick Setup)

1. **Get the repo**  
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS).  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
     cd your-repo
     ```

2. **Make your folder**  
   - In the terminal:
     ```bash
     mkdir Team05_1RV21CS001_SmartIrrigation
     ```
   - Or just right-click â†’ New Folder in your file manager and name it correctly.

3. **Add your files**  
   - Drag and drop (or copy-paste) *all* your code, reports, images, etc. into that folder.

4. **Send it to GitHub**  
   - Back in the terminal:
     ```bash
     git add Team05_1RV21CS001_SmartIrrigation/
     git commit -m "Team 05: Smart Irrigation (1RV21CS001)"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - If `main` isnâ€™t found, try `master`.
